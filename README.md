# Azure-Terraform-LabinaBox
Terraform Landing Zones leveraged to build out a Hybrid Multi Region Environment with private endpoints.

## Overview

Provide a repository to quickly build out demo/poc environments to test different use cases.  Solution is broken into Landing Zones to allow individual components to be modified without affecting the entire solution and to provide the option of deploying.  Two Core sections exist within the solution.  Landing Zones and AppZones.  Landing Zones will provide the core infrastructure which will be needed to deploy applications which will be housed within the AppZones.  Both will provide the option for Multi-Region or Single Region deployment.  Separate ReadMe documents exist for each Section.
